1- Always use semicolons ; to end statements.
2- Don't use conditions or loops without braces {}. 
	Don't write if (abc == true) alert("hello");
	Write 
		if(abc == true){
			alert("hello");
		}
3- Starting Curly bracket should begin on same line the function declaration or loop or condition or try/catch block begins. It should not be on second line.
	WRONG WAY:
		if(abc == true)
		{
			alert("hello");
		}
	CORRECT WAY:	
		if(abc == true){
			alert("hello");
		}
5- Use camelCase for variables and function names. Constants start with capital letters.
4- Always begin new variables with var keyword so that reader knows that this variables is being declared for first time.
5- Use double quotes as much as possible, unless you are appending html in string. Use double quotes inside HTML in that case and use single quotes for javascript.
